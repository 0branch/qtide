jexe.tlb is a binary file encoding the com interface type library

jexe.rc includes jexe.tlb

midl.exe (originally mktyplib.exe) builds jexe.tlb from:
 jexeodl.h  jexe.odl (which includes methods.odl)

build.bat builds jexe.tlb binary from the 3 source files

build.bat must be run under vs developer command prompt with midl as current folder
(start>all programs>vs 2013>visual studio tools>developer command prompt)

new jexe.tlb should be manually copied to dllsrc for inclusion in new build
